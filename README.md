# Captcha-Solver
You can use this solver for Supreme, Shopify, etc just replace the host and sitekey for the site you want to solve for

This solver removes expired captcha tokens automatically

Make a GET request to 127.0.0.1:8080/fetch to grab the token, once you make a GET request it also removes the token
# Instructions

To start it first run npm install and then npm start

- Currently you have to log out and remove your gmail after each time you start up the solver but I will be updating it soon
